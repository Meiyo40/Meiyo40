- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Meiyo
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in everything! (But Rust > All ðŸ’˜)
- ðŸŒ±  I'm in training to learn more about program design (I already have a Bac+2 in web development), but also learning UnrealEngine 5 (BP and C++) while working on a multiplayer shooter prototype myself (and other small sandbox tests) and another game this time in a more experienced team.
I've used vanilla php/Symfony/Springboot/Rust for a few projects, though not being a front-end guy, I've learned the basics of React and Angular.
I try to work as much as possible with reliability and maintainability of my programs in mind, and I really want to learn more about optimizations (algorithms, language tricks) and security of my applications.
Time is my worst enemy. I need the days to last 48 hours...
